# Budgeted Expense Tracker

This is a responsive weekly expense tracker built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is mainly used to showcase my front-end skills in the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No framework was used in building this expense tracker.

Thus far, it has helped me improve in object-oriented programming as well as DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

## Limitations of This Project

 1. When an expense is added, it can't be deleted.
 1. It has an input pop-up onload for amount instead on an embedded input in html.
 1. It does not save expenses for later view after quit.

  > It mainly showcases my ability to build a responsive mobile friendly view with no framework.

  >I am Working on a better expense tracker with options like, salary, investment and expenses (add and delete inclusive). I may use JavaScript Framework in the new Expense Tracker.
